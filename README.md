# MyReads

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* install the Router dependency with `npm react-router-dom`
* start the development server with `npm start`

This is a project that allows you to keep a neatly sorted list of books that you are currently reading, books you want to read, and books you have read. There is also a search page so you can add new books to any of the lists whenever you want.
